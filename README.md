# Code-Examples
This is a collection of programs I have written for my certificate in Database Design and SQL or in my self-directed learning of Python and R. This is meant to demonstrate my capability and experience in these programs to prospective employers.
<br>The questions and prompts provided in my SQL assignments belong to and were issued by professors at Portland Community College.
<br>Please note that the codes I wrote were later graded and corrected.
<br>If you have any questions, please reach out to me at skylerhurlin@gmail.com.
