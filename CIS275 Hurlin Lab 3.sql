What is on TV?
---------------
This is an exact repeat of Question 7 from Lab Week 2. However, instead of using the all_data 
view, instead JOIN the CHANNEL, SHOW, and SCHEDULE tables together. Consult the ERD (if needed)
to determine which columns to match in the ON parts of the JOINs.

Show the first 100 TV shows that start on 9/10/2017 at 8:00PM (StartTime is 20:00:00).

Display results in order by ChannelNumber. 

Show ONLY the DisplayName, ChannelNumber, StartTime, EndTime, and Title.

Use CONVERT to format the StartTime and EndTime hh:mi:ss without the day, month, or year. 

Use CAST or CONVERT make DisplayName 10 characters wide, and Title 30 characters wide. 

Make sure all columns have appropriate names (using AS where needed).

Hint: A DATETIME column can be matched against a string like 8/30/1962 13:00:00.

Hint 2: Correct results will have 100 rows, and look like this:

HD Channels
-----------
Find channels in the CHANNEL table where there is a matching HD channel. For this problem,
only retrieve channels where the DisplayName of the standard definition channel matches the
DisplayName of the HD channel with an HD added to the end (ignore the case where, for example,
SYFYP matches SYFYHDP). Produce results as shown below, using 10 characters for both display
names, and ordering by Standard Name.

Hint: JOIN CHANNEL to itself and alias the tables using AS.

Hint 2: The correct answer will have 58 rows and will look like this:

HD Channels Part 2
------------------
Repeat the previous query, except this time use a CROSS JOIN. Add a WHERE
clause that matches display names that end in P with display names that end in
HDP.

Note: There are ways to do this that don''t require a CROSS JOIN, but use a CROSS
JOIN anyway.

Hint: The function LEFT will return the left part of a string. For example, given
a column like "Animal", with a value like "fruitbat", the function LEFT(Animal, 5)
will return the value "fruit". The function RIGHT(Animal, 3) will return the value
"bat". The function LEN(Animal) will return 8.

Find TV episodes in the SHOW table that aren''t currently scheduled. Include only results that have
an episode name and a description.

Use DISTINCT. To match my results, title and episode should be 20 characters wide and description should

Eraserhead
----------
We''ll be switching over to the IMDB database for the remaining questions this week.

Show all principals listed for the movie "Eraserhead." For each principal, show the name of the movie,
the category, and the name of the principal. Also include the characters that actors and actresses
played (display N/A for NULL values). Format all columns to 20 characters wide.

Display in order by name.

Hint: title_basics has information about shows and name_basics has information about people.
title_principals links people to shows with information about the what kind of job the
person had on the show. Use the category column in title_principals here, rather than the job column.

Produce a list of all of Quentin Tarantino''s movies in descending order by rating. Format title as 30 characters
wide. Your results should appear as below (I escaped the apostrophe in the last result).

Hint: title_ratings contains the number of votes and average rating for each show.

Top 10 SF Series
----------------
Find the 10 most highly rated SF TV series. Include only series with 10000 or more votes.
Format Title using 30 characters.

Hint: Use SELECT DISTINCT genre and SELECT DISTINCT titleType to determine the correct
values to use to match SF TV series.

Correct results will look like this:

------------------------------
Use INTERSECT and the title_principals table to find all movies where David Lynch and
Angelo Badalamenti worked together. Include ID and Title, format Title as 20 characters wide, and 
order alphabetically by Title. Don''t bother with title_directors or title_writers, just use 
title_principals.
